## Overview
Stock market forecasting is a complex task that involves analyzing historical prices, volumes, and market trends. In this project, I applied machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to predict the stock prices of various companies.

Each company in this project has its own dedicated folder containing the respective stock data, analysis, and models.

## Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- **Tesla, Apple, BAC, etc.:** Each company folder contains company-specific data, analysis scripts, and results for stock price forecasting.
- **utils.py:** File containing functions for processing and creating plots.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from publicly available sources such as:
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)



## Company-specific Analysis
Each subfolder contains a README file with details about the stock price forecasting analysis for that particular company. The analysis includes:

* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Time series forecasting models (ARIMA)
* Results and conclusions
